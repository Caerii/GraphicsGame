# GraphicsGame
A game for our CS452 Graphics Class. You are the president of the school and you need to absorb everyone and everything.

# Pseudocode:
# We have one sprite and it's a circle. This is the player. It needs to be able to be played with the wasd keys and the arrow keys.
# We need to have a map, we define the geometry of where you can and cannot go. We have to figure out the bounding boxes for the map
# There will be circles in the environment, when you move over them they disappear and you become either bigger or smaller.
# Green square consumption makes you bigger, and red triangle consumption makes you smaller.
# 1200 width x 800 height clipspace
